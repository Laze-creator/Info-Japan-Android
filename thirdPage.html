        Have you ever noticed a lot of cars of a certain model only after you or someone you know has bought it, whereas before you didn't even see them? <br>
        Well, this is exactly the same thing. If you were born in the 80's or later, you must have seen an anime on TV.<br>
        Most probably without even realizing it. You know those cartoons you watched as a kid on TV before school: <br>
        Saylor Moon, Holly and Benji, Dragon Ball and Rossana? That's it, they're all Japanese anime.

        The term anime is derived from animÄ“shon, the translation of animation into English.<br>
        Anime is both a commercial entertainment product, a mass popular cultural phenomenon and a technological <br>
        art form that is produced for different audiences such as children, teenagers and adults. <br>
        Japan's anime formats are commonly referred to as TV anime (TVA), original video anime (OVA), movie and NET anime (NETA).
        So basically an anime is an animation of a manga or light novel, therefore a frametisation of drawings made by hand with sometimes the use of cgi,<br>
         which consists of a software that simulates through the computer movements too complex to make by hand.

  The first anime to be released on television was "Tetsuwan Atom" (Astro Boy) by Osamu Tezuka in 1963 and lasted 193 episodes of 30 minutes each. <br>
  It was after the first half of the sixties that the animation industry boomed: production studios multiplied, <br>
  techniques became more and more refined, and private television stations, as well as the state television NHK, progressively increased their demand for animated series.<br>
  In addition, from the beginning and more and more often, anime characters were exploited for advertising purposes, followed by the birth of merchandising gadgets and models.

  There are many ways to watch anime, such as Netflix, TV, paid sites, or the most popular but not recommended for legal reasons, free streaming sites.<br>
  Examples of free streaming sites include AnimesaturyAnimeunity, Animeworld and many others. Instead for platforms that hold the rights to anime and are therefore legal,<br>
  we can mention Crunchyroll, VVVID and Yamato Animation. A tip to start watching anime is to see those that are a bit mainstream but not at the level of Dragonball.<br>
  I'm talking about anime like Attack On Titan and Sword Art Online, and then move on to titles that are a bit more sophisticated.
